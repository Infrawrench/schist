//! Smart objects.
//!
//! A smart object keeps its *source* pixels alongside the transform that
//! places them on the canvas, and re-renders from the source every time the
//! transform changes. That is the whole point: scaling a smart object down
//! to a tenth and back up again returns the original, where doing the same
//! to an ordinary layer would leave you with a tenth of the detail
//! resampled up.
//!
//! The raster here is the placement cache. Editable nested documents and
//! optional filesystem links are carried by [`crate::smart_source::SmartSource`]
//! in a private layer block, so those sources survive saves and shared history.
